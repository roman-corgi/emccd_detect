# Used to make a smaller-scale full frame for the purpose of having
# smaller file sizes for test data for tpump_analysis.

# Any regions not specified are assumed to be shielded or unused pixels.
#
# Geometry regions are defined as:
#   rows: number of region rows
#   cols: number of region columns
#   r0c0: coordinates (row, col) of the corner closest to (0, 0) of the array
#
# For example, in a 5x5 array, the following geometry would look as follows:
#   rows: 2
#   cols: 3
#   r0c0:
#     - 2
#     - 1
#
# [
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#     [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# ]
#
# where (0, 0) is defined as the top left of this array.
